This repo is the one i use to learn DSA 
DSA is not only for cracking software interviews 
It is a step towards problem solving and critical thinking 
And I want to do it so.. i thought of practicing these before stating on Leetcode where i can solve real problesms through algorithms !

#i think i will start with algorithms first
